<p>GRAPLEr brings the power of distributed computing to the fingertips of lake ecology modelers. While it is relatively easy to run one lake model simulation on a personal computer, it is more difficult to execute multiple simulations, which requires additional computing and human resources. To overcome this problem, GRAPLEr, a distributed computing system, integrates and applies overlay virtual network, high-throughput computing, and Web service technologies. GRAPLEr allows submission of hundreds or thousands of General Lake Model (GLM) simulations, runs these lake model simulations efficiently, and retrieves model output.</p>

<p>By connecting the scientific community with data and model resources, the <a href="http://www.gleon.org/">GLEON</a> Research and <a href="http://www.pragma-grid.net/">PRAGMA</a> Lake Expedition (GRAPLE) enables advanced simulation of lake hydrodynamics and water quality to address research questions. A key goal of the expedition is to bring distributed computing technologies to lake ecology researchers and students, by bringing together a suite of cyber-infrastructure tools that can be used through simple interfaces - e.g. the R/R-Studio environment at a user's desktop.</p>

<p>GRAPLE combines the <a href="http://ipop-project.org/">IPOP</a> overlay virtual network, the <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/">HTCondor</a> batch job scheduler, and Web Service technologies. It allows participating GLEON/PRAGMA institutions to aggregate computational resources and across a distributed group of collaborators and institutions, and presents interfaces that automate the preparation and scheduling of batches of executions of the General Lake Model <a href="http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/">GLM</a>.</p>

<p>Participants in the expedition are able to easily join a HTCondor high-throughput computing resource pool, with their own local computers (desktops, laptops, servers) by using the IPOP virtual network overlay. Once connected to the HTCondor pool, users can then run batches of simulations (such as parametric sweep runs of the GLM model) in an efficient manner. Users can also access the cyber-infrastructure through GRAPLEr, which provides an interface accessible through R.</p>
