### Update to GRAPLEr 3.1.2

In RStudio on your machine, run:

```
devtools::install_github("GRAPLE/GRAPLEr")
```

This will install the latest version of GRAPLEr on your machine and replace the old version, if that exists.
To make sure it has updated to v3.1.2, run:

```
packageVersion("GRAPLEr")
```

The output should be:

```
[1] ‘3.1.2’
```
