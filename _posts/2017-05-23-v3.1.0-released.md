## Minor Change

* A few bugs have been fixed.

## Instructions

**Important Note 1:** This version is not backward compatible. You won't be able to use previous versions of GRAPLEr.

**Important Note 2:** The default submission URL is `https://graple.acis.ufl.edu/`. If you are setting the submission URL manually, remember to use it with `https`, not `http`. Otherwise, you will get an error after running the experiment.

### Update to GRAPLEr 3.1.0

In RStudio on your machine, run:

```
devtools::install_github("GRAPLE/GRAPLEr")
```

This will install the latest version of GRAPLEr on your machine and replace the old version, if that exists.
To make sure it has updated to v3.1.0, run:

```
packageVersion("GRAPLEr")
```

The output should be:

```
[1] ‘3.1.0’
```
