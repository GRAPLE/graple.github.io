{"name":"GRAPLE","tagline":"Distributed computing made easy for lake ecology modeling","body":"### Welcome to GRAPLE.\r\nGRAPLEr brings the power of distributing computing to the fingertips of lake ecology modelers. It is a suite of software tools for connecting to the GRAPLE Web Service (GWS) and running GRAPLE jobs. Experiments consisting of thousands of simulations can be evaluated in a fraction of the time by submitting batches of GLM (General Lake Model) simulations to a distributed computing system, directly from your R/RStudio environment.\r\n\r\n### The GLEON/PRAGMA Expedition\r\n\r\nBy connecting the scientific community with data and model resources, the [GLEON](http://www.gleon.org/) Research and [PRAGMA](http://www.pragma-grid.net/) Lake Expedition (GRAPLE) enables advanced simulation of lake hydrodynamics and water quality to address research questions. A key goal of the expedition is to bring distributed computing technologies to lake ecology researchers and students, by bringing together a suite of cyber-infrastructure tools that can be used through simple interfaces - e.g. the R/R-Studio environment at a user's desktop.\r\n\r\nGRAPLE combines the [IPOP](http://ipop-project.org/) overlay virtual network, the [HTCondor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) batch job scheduler, and Web Service technologies. It allows participating GLEON/PRAGMA institutions to aggregate computational resources and across a distributed group of collaborators and institutions, and presents interfaces that automate the preparation and scheduling of batches of executions of the General Lake Model [GLM](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/).\r\n\r\nParticipants in the expedition are able to easily join a HTCondor high-throughput computing resource pool, with their own local computers (desktops, laptops, servers) by using the IPOP virtual network overlay. Once connected to the HTCondor pool, users can then run batches of simulations (such as parametric sweep runs of the GLM model) in an efficient manner. Users can also access the cyber-infrastructure through GRAPLEr, which provides an interface accessible through R.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nYou can go through the [project EDDIE](http://www.acis.ufl.edu/~renato/graple/LakeModelingModule_28Sep15.R) module used in a workshop at GLEON17 to test-drive the execution of hundreds of GLM model runs through GRAPLEr\r\n\r\n### Contact us\r\n\r\nFor additional information, contact Renato Figueiredo (renato at acis.ufl.edu), Cayelan Carey (cayelan at vt.edu) or Paul Hanson (pchanson at wisc.edu)\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nGRAPLEr has been developed as a collaboration between researchers in PRAGMA and GLEON, with support from a supplement the the PRAGMA award (NSF OCI-1234983).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
